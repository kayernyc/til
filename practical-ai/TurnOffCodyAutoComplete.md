# Turning Off AI AutoComplete

I updated my VS Code, restarted my computer, and suddenly I couldn't get any code written. 

I have **Cody AI by Sourcegraph** installed and it was "helpfully" auto-completing even comments, based on the barest hints. Naturally its guesses were way off the mark.

The read difficulty was that I was stuck in a loop of constantly trying to head off its comments and code hints. If I hit `tab` I had to go back and delete its code.

At first I thought it might be Microsoft, but after some fruitless searching I happed on the response of another unhappy human. 

In the lower bar on the right-hand side there is a Cody button that aliases to the preferences. You can turn off the hinting there.
