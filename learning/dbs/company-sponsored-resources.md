# Company sponsored resources for learning Mongo and MySQL

When I went to the [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) conference in New York two weeks ago, I found out about their learning paths, which includes a discount on the first certificate attempt.

Around the same time I discovered that [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com/) has a free course for developers by [Aaron Francis](https://aaronfrancis.com/). It builds up an understanding of how schema databases work by starting with developer-focused fundamentals.

As someone who has only tinkered (or hacked) databases into doing what I need, and would just as happily use a dictionary object, I was surprised by how interesting these courses are!
